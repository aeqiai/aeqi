# AEQI Web Dashboard

Frontend for the AEQI agent runtime. Vite + React 19 + Zustand + TypeScript.

## Before any UI change

Read [`./.impeccable.md`](./.impeccable.md). It's the design-system
constitution — palette, typefaces, ratio rule, locked toolbar zones,
anti-references. Non-negotiable; supersedes any default behavior the
agent would otherwise drift toward.

For component APIs and pattern recipes, the Storybook docs are the
canonical reference:

- `src/components/ui/Welcome.mdx` — sidebar map, where to look for what.
- `src/components/ui/docs/Foundations*.mdx` — color, typography, spacing,
  radii, motion, principles.
- `src/components/ui/docs/Patterns*.mdx` — composed recipes.
  `PatternsToolbar.mdx` is the canonical search / sort / filter / view /
  + New layout, including the chrome / paper / ink tier rule.

When a need doesn't map to an existing primitive, propose a new one
before writing a page-level class. Grep before adding any new style or
component — the codebase has more primitives than the file structure
suggests.

## MVP charter — read this before touching any UI

**The goal is to ship the MVP.** Every UI decision must be measured against
"does this get us closer to a usable product the user can demo?" If a change
isn't on that path, don't make it.

### Hard rules

1. **Use the design system. Don't invent.**
   - Tokens live in `src/styles/primitives.css` (`--color-*`, `--text-*`,
     `--bg-*`, `--accent`, `--border*`, `--input-*`, `--space-*`,
     `--radius-*`, `--font-*`). Use them.
   - Reusable components live in `src/components/ui/` (Button, IconButton,
     Input, Select, Menu, Popover, Spinner, Badge, EmptyState, Tooltip).
     Use them. Extend them via variants — don't fork.
   - Surface-level patterns (`.ideas-toolbar-btn`, `.ideas-tag-chip`,
     `.ideas-list-head`, `.scope-dot`) are canonical for their surface and
     should be reused, not re-skinned.

2. **No custom design.**
   - No bespoke colors. No new font sizes outside the scale. No new spacing
     values outside the 4pt grid. No new border radii. No new shadow values.
   - If a token is missing, add it to `primitives.css` (or
     `packages/tokens/src/tokens.css`) once, then reuse it. Don't sprinkle
     literal values through component CSS.
   - No "I'll just make it work for this one screen" CSS overrides. If a
     pattern doesn't fit, surface that as feedback before forking.

3. **Reuse over rewrite.**
   - Before adding a new component, search `src/components/` for one that
     fits. If something close exists, extend it (add a prop or variant).
   - Before writing fresh CSS, search `src/styles/` for the pattern. If a
     class already does this, use it.
   - Buttons in toolbars use `.ideas-toolbar-btn` (or its design-system
     successor). Pills use `border-radius: 999px`. Icons are 13px stroked
     SVGs. There is one canonical answer for each — find it.

4. **No flourish without function.**
   - No animations beyond `transition: 0.12s ease` on hover/focus states.
     No bounce, no elastic, no scroll-driven, no decorative motion.
   - No editorial flourishes (eyebrow micro-caps, marquee headings, hero
     typography) on internal app surfaces. Reserve those for marketing.
   - No icons that don't disambiguate an action.

5. **Drop dead code on the same commit.**
   - When a class/component/file is no longer used, remove it. Don't leave
     "// removed" comments. Don't leave dead CSS rules. CLAUDE.md says
     "no dead code" — enforce it on every ship.

### Anti-patterns to refuse

- **Border-left coloured stripe** on cards/rows/alerts (memory has rejected
  this twice; impeccable hard-bans it).
- **Gradient text** (`background-clip: text` + gradient).
- **Glassmorphism** (backdrop-blur on resting surfaces).
- **Rounded-square buttons.** Pills (`999px`) for labeled, circles
  (`999px`) for icon-only. Nothing in between.
- **Verbose state labels** ("Edited — unsaved", "Saving…", "Saved").
  Communicate state through presence (the Save button appears when there's
  work) or a single colored dot, not prose.
- **Custom scope/status chips per surface.** Use `.scope-chip` /
  `.scope-dot` / the existing primitives.
- **JetBrains Mono.** Removed from the design system; use `var(--font-mono)`
  which now resolves to the system mono stack.
- **Initial-letter brand accents** on tabs/nav (`a` `e` `q` `i` letters in
  Zen Dots — rejected twice).
- **"AEQI" in prose.** "aeqi" is always lowercase outside code identifiers.

### When in doubt

Ask. The user prefers a 30-second clarifying question over a 30-minute
custom-design detour. If something feels like it needs a one-off treatment,
that's almost always a sign the existing pattern needs a small extension —
not a fork.

The user is shipping a product, not commissioning a design system. Move
fast, reuse hard, and don't make them puke.



## Stack

- **Build:** Vite 6, React 19, TypeScript 5
- **State:** Zustand (auth store, daemon store, chat store, ui store)
- **Routing:** React Router v7
- **Styling:** CSS custom properties in `src/styles/primitives.css` (graphite + ink v5.1 palette, Inter + Exo 2 + Zen Dots; JetBrains Mono retired 2026-04-27, `--font-mono` falls back to the system mono stack)
- **API:** `src/lib/api.ts` -- fetch wrapper with JWT auth, auto-redirect on 401

## Layout

Two-column layout: AgentTree sidebar (left, 240px) + content area with floating nav bar (search via Cmd+K, page links). Content renders in `<Outlet />` inside the content panel.

## Primitives

The UI is built around four primitives:
- **Agent** -- autonomous entities with parent-child hierarchy
- **Quest** -- work items (formerly "tasks")
- **Event** -- audit/activity stream
- **Idea** -- agent knowledge, identity, instructions, memories

## Pages

| Page | Path | What it does |
|------|------|-------------|
| Dashboard | `/` | Stats, active quests, activity feed |
| Quests | `/quests` | Quest list, filter by status/agent |
| Sessions | `/sessions` | Split pane: session list + transcript. WebSocket chat with agents |
| Events | `/events` | Event stream (audit trail) |
| Ideas | `/ideas` | Agent knowledge/idea search |
| Agent Detail | `/agents/:name` | Agent identity, files, activity |
| Settings | `/settings` | Daemon connection, logout |
| Login | `/login` | JWT authentication |

Legacy paths redirect to their current equivalents.

## State Stores

| Store | File | Purpose |
|-------|------|---------|
| auth | `src/store/auth.ts` | JWT token, login/logout |
| daemon | `src/store/daemon.ts` | Agents, quests, events, cost, status |
| chat | `src/store/chat.ts` | Selected agent, per-agent thread state |
| ui | `src/store/ui.ts` | UI preferences (sidebar, layout) |

## Deployment

```bash
cd apps/ui
npm run build
```

- Build outputs to `apps/ui/dist`
- Set `[web].ui_dist_dir` in `aeqi.toml`
- Run `aeqi web start`

## Dev

```bash
npm run dev  # Vite dev server on :5173, proxies /api to :8400
```
